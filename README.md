# NOSQL Social Network API
Assignment application for Week 18 - NOSQL for bootcamp

## Task
Creating a back end database application that runs for a hypothetical social network - using both the terminal, the software Insomni, and MongoDB Compass. As well as the dependencies Express and Mongoose.

This database is able to keep track of the users information, such as id numbers, emails, and usernames, as well as their friend lists and being able to add and remove friends from that list and keep a count of how many friends they have. This database is also supposed to keep track of these users' thoughts, their reactions, and counts the number of reactions they get - however, due to unknown reasons, I couldn't get the thoughts function to work.

## Video Link
Since there is no actual publicly deployed application, and this is all in the backend, here is a walkthrough video to show the functionality of the application.
